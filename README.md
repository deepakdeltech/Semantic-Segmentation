# Semantic-Segmentation
Semantic segmentation with TensorFlow and OpenCV
> Developed a semantic segmentation pipeline leveraging TensorFlow and OpenCV to identify and segment objects in images.
> Implemented a Mask R-CNN model using pre-trained weights for precise segmentation of multiple classes.
> Utilized OpenCV's DNN module for model integration and optimized image processing techniques for visualization.
> Designed custom scripts for overlaying segmentation masks on input images to generate intuitive visual outputs.
> Gained experience in handling pre-trained models, blob generation, and drawing segmented regions with bounding boxes and masks.
